# To Do:
- [x] Define the characters direction of travel.
- [x] Call function collidable()
- [x] Define drawChar() function
- [x] check direction the character is moving for drawChar()
- [x] use ../tutorials/lovewikitutorials/grid to set motion rates
- [x] use above to draw actual vs grid character positions
- [x] Reflect left image into right in code
- [ ] turn all character related variables into tables
- [ ] create character Class using MiddleClass
- [x] Use multiple frames to make character walk
- [ ] Make character movement smooth
- [ ] Match character walking frames up to tile movement
- [x] Make map collidable function
- [x] Make entity collidable function
- [x] Set Name for Game Window
- [ ] Separate Entity and Map loading
- [x] Create grass map from ff art
- [x] Fix window mapping to accept 16 pixel map and character art
- [ ] Place entities on map from ff art
- [x] Back up into Github
- [ ] Add an input.lua module that can be called from each function block
-  [ ] Add input.lua which has a function to intialize the variable, call from love.load()
-  [ ] Create insert function to table for inputs, call from char-functions.lua for movement
- [ ] add pcall() functions into char-functions for out of bounds
- [ ] learn how to use MiddleClass and Stateful
- [ ] use Stateful to create GameStates
- [ ] implement a toWorld function that blows everything up
